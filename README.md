# Clone of openai.com

This is a portfolio project meant to showcase my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

This project does not make use of any library or framework as it is intended to show knowledge of the underlying technologies only. 

## Project scope

This is purely a front-end project. The clone will consist only of the landing page of the site. Any and all links will go nowhere. 

All effects will be reproduced includding animations, videos, popups and drop downs.

## Technologies used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Credits

All assets used for this project including the design and ui layout belong to their respective owners and/or openai.com.

Only the code that I wrote myself to reproduce this website is my own.
